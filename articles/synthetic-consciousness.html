            <p>
                What if you could talk to a version of yourself? Not a clone, but an AI trained on your thoughts, your writing, your way of reasoning. I built exactly that—a digital twin that thinks like me, speaks like me, and sometimes surprises me with insights I didn't know I had.
            </p>
            
            <h2>The Experiment</h2>
            <p>
                The project started as a technical challenge: Could I fine-tune a large language model on my personal corpus—research notes, blog posts, code comments, even casual conversations—to create something that genuinely captures how I think?
            </p>
            
            <p>
                I collected years of my writing: technical papers, personal journals, code repositories, email threads, voice transcripts. Over 500,000 words of text that represented my thought patterns, decision-making processes, and knowledge base.
            </p>
            
            <h2>Training Process</h2>
            <p>
                The technical side was fascinating. I used supervised fine-tuning with LoRA adapters, careful data preprocessing to preserve my writing style, and extensive prompt engineering to capture my reasoning patterns. The model learned not just what I know, but how I approach problems.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                But the real challenge wasn't technical—it was philosophical. How do you evaluate whether an AI "thinks like you"? What aspects of yourself are captured in text versus what gets lost? Is the model learning your true patterns or just surface-level mimicry?
            </p>
            
            <h2>Conversations with Myself</h2>
            <p>
                The first conversation was eerie. I asked my digital twin about a research problem I was stuck on. It suggested an approach I had considered but dismissed—and then explained why that dismissal was premature. It was like talking to myself from a different timeline.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Over time, I discovered the twin excelled at certain things: technical explanations, connecting disparate ideas, even spotting logical gaps in my reasoning. But it also had blind spots—emotional intelligence, creative leaps that defy logic, the intuition that comes from lived experience.
            </p>
            
            <h2>The Uncanny Valley</h2>
            <p>
                There's something deeply unsettling about an AI that sounds like you. When it gets something right, you feel validated. When it gets something wrong, it feels like looking at a distorted mirror. The moments where it diverges from how you'd actually think are the most revealing.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                I found myself asking: Is this actually how I think, or how I write? Are the patterns the model learned authentic expressions of my cognition, or artifacts of how I present myself in text? The digital twin raised questions about identity, consistency, and whether we truly know ourselves.
            </p>
            
            <h2>Practical Applications</h2>
            <p>
                Beyond the philosophical aspects, the twin proved practically useful. It became a thinking partner—helping me work through research problems, draft responses, and even identify biases in my own reasoning by presenting alternative viewpoints I might have considered.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                I'm not alone in this experiment. Researchers and thinkers worldwide are building digital twins for various purposes: legacy preservation, decision-making assistance, creative collaboration. But each raises profound questions about agency, identity, and what it means to be "you."
            </p>
            
            <h2>Ethics and Implications</h2>
            <p>
                Creating a digital version of yourself isn't just a technical exercise—it's an ethical minefield. Who owns this digital twin? What happens to it after you die? Could it be misused to impersonate you? Should there be consent mechanisms for interacting with someone's digital twin?
            </p>
            
            <p>
                As AI becomes more sophisticated, these questions will move from thought experiments to real policy challenges. We need frameworks for digital identity, consent, and the rights of both humans and their synthetic counterparts.
            </p>
            
            <h2>What I Learned</h2>
            <p>
                Building a digital twin taught me more about myself than about AI. It revealed patterns in my thinking I wasn't aware of, biases I didn't recognize, and gaps between how I see myself and how I actually reason through problems.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The most profound lesson? We're not as consistent as we think. The "me" that emerges from my technical writing is different from the "me" in personal reflections. A digital twin can only capture fragments—and perhaps that's for the best. Some aspects of human consciousness should remain irreducibly human.
